    "This is a tutorial demonstrating how to set up a foundation network of virtual machines (VM) on Ubuntu 16.04 which can be used to practice digital forensics, networking and penetration testing. The foundation network contains 3 routers and 3 pcs, a metasploitable 2 LAMP server and a Kali Linux host. Other servers and hosts, with varying operating systems, etc. can be added to the network to customize it. \n",
